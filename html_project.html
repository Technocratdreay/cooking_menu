                    Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice. <br>
                    Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. <br>
                    Nigerian fried rice is made with long-grain rice, protein (such as beef liver, chicken, pork, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on.

                <h3>STEPS TO PREPARE FRIED RICE</h3>
                <p>PART 1: MAKING THE RICE<p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rinse the rice with cold water and pour it into a large pot.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place 1 cup (178 g) of dry rice into a fine mesh strainer.</li>
                            <li>Run cold water over the rice and use your hands to gently rinse the rice.</li>
                            <li>You can use basmati, white, or jasmine rice for this recipe. <a href="https://cheflolaskitchen.com/nigerian-fried-rice-recipe/">[1]</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Add 2 cups (473 ml) of water to the large pot.</li>
                        <li>Boil the mixture over high heat for 5 minutes.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bring the water to a full rolling boil.</li>
                            <li>Then, start your timer and let the rice boil for 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Keep the lid off of the pot while the liquid heats up so it doesn't boil over.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Transfer the rice to a fine mesh strainer.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turn off the heat and hold a fine mesh strainer over your sink.</li>
                            <li>Pour the mixture into the strainer to drain the water from the rice.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Place the strainer in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fill a large bowl with cold water.</li>
                            <li>Put the fine mesh strainer into the bowl of water so the rice can soak for several minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Rinse off the rice with cold water. </li>
                        <li>Put 1/2 cup (118 ml) of stock in a large pot and bring it to a boil. </li>
                        <li>Add the parboiled rice and boil the mixture for 25 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>PART 2: FRYING THE VEGGIES AND RICE</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Saut√© the onions for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vegetable oil into a large skillet or wok and turn the heat to medium.</li>
                        <li>Once the oil is hot and shimmers, add the diced onion and saute for a couple of minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Stir in the mixed vegetables, stock cube, and seasonings.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add 1 cup (128 g) of diced mixed vegetables to the skillet.</li>
                        <li>Then, stir in 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of thyme, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of curry powder, and 1 stock cube.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Fry the vegetables for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stir and cook the vegetable mixture over medium heat until the vegetables are heated through.</li>
                        <li>Avoid overcooking the vegetables or they'll lose their shape and vibrant color.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Add the rice and fry everything together for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transfer the rice to the skillet with the seasoned vegetables and stir the mixture until it's combined.</li>
                        <li>Stir-fry the mixture for 3-5 minutes, stirring continuously.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat and serve the fried rice immediately for the best flavor.</li>
                        <li>Put any leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate it for 5-7 days.</li>
                    </ul>
